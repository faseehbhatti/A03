GIT

Step 1. First you need to create an account with GITHUB. 
        GITHUB is a version control system that keeps track of changes to a source code and allows multiple people to work on it at the same time

Step 2. After you create a GITHUB account, you should create a Webstorm account and download the program. 
        Webstorm is a Javascript integrated development environment (IDE) that can connect to your GITHUB account.

Step 3. After downloading and installing Webstorm, you must install GIT as a local program. 
        GIT is a version control software that keeps track of the changes to source code.
